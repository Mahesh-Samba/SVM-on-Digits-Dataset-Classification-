# SVM-on-Digits-Dataset-Classification-
Utilizing SVC on load digits dataset
This code utilizes the digits dataset from sklearn.datasets, containing images of handwritten digits (0-9). It performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by displaying the dataset's shape and target names, visualizing sample images of the digits, and depicting the class distribution across the dataset. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, an SVM classifier (SVC) is trained to recognize handwritten digits. The model's performance is evaluated using a classification report, providing insights into its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score across different digit classes
